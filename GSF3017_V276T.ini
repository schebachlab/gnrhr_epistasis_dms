# Schlebach Laboratory DMS sort seq analysis, paired-end reads, barcode-based pipeline
# Configuration file: GSF3017_V276T.ini
# Date of analysis: 22 Jan 2022
# Performed by: Laura M Chamness (lmchamne@iu.edu)
# Describe the experiment: GnRHR epistasis DMS profile, replicate 1 (performed by LCM), V276T background, replicate 1 ("rep1"), run 1, CGB dictionary with >0.75 penetrance, used R1 and R2 reads, using V276T single mutant control as "WT" MFI

[Data from DMS experiment]
# GnRHR epistasis DMS profile, replicate 1 (performed by LCM), V276T background, replicate 1 ("rep1"), run 1 with V276T dictionary from CGB (Chris) with >0.75 mutant + background penetrance, using single mutant (barcoded) control sample as "WT" MFI instead of the library combined fractions
