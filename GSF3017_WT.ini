# Schlebach Laboratory DMS sort seq analysis, paired-end reads, barcode-based pipeline
# Configuration file: GSF3017_WT.ini
# Date of analysis: 22 Jan 2022
# Performed by: Laura M Chamness (lmchamne@iu.edu)
# Describe the experiment: GnRHR epistasis DMS profile, replicate 1 (performed by LCM), WT background, replicate 1 ("rep1"), run 1, CGB dictionary derived from pacbio with >0.75 penetrance, used R1 and R2 reads, using the WT (barcoded) control sample for the "WT" MFI instead of the combined library fractions
