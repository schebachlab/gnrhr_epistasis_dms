# Schlebach Laboratory DMS sort seq analysis, paired-end reads, barcode-based pipeline
# Configuration file: GSF3017_W107A.ini
# Date of analysis: 22 Jan 2022
# Performed by: Laura M Chamness (lmchamne@iu.edu)
# Describe the experiment: GnRHR epistasis DMS profile, replicate 1 (performed by LCM), W107A background, replicate 1 ("rep1"), run 1, CGB dictionary with >0.75 penetrance, used R1 and R2 reads, using W107A single mutant (barcoded) control sample as "WT" MFI instead of combined library fractions
