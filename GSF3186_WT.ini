# Schlebach Laboratory DMS sort seq analysis, paired-end reads, barcode-based pipeline
# Configuration file: GSF3186_WT.ini
# Date of analysis: 02 May 2022
# Performed by: Laura M Chamness (lmchamne@iu.edu)
# Describe the experiment: GnRHR epistasis DMS profile, replicate 2 (performed by LMC), WT background, replicate 2 ("rep2"), run 1 with CGB dictionary derived from pacbio with >0.75 penetrance, used R1 and R2 reads, using the WT (barcoded) external control sample for the "WT" MFI
